			<div class="bio">
				<p>Ginger is a Goldendoodle who is ready to work for her country. She's the fur-st dog of her kind to run for election in 2020. She's lived in beautiful Fairport, NY most of her life with her family of five. She is running for the President of the United States of America to bring a new outlook and excitable energy to this beautiful country. Ginger's been guarding her house since she was able to walk up the stairs and loves to look out upon her beautiful neighborhood. </p>
				<p>Her involvement in politics is vast, including multiple political positions, hundreds of hours of community service, and a commitment to her country. Ginger's campaign has been largely grassroots but she's climbing the ladder to the top nonetheless. She believes with some hard work and perserverance, we can make this country strong and a tight knit community where everyone belongs, whether dog or human.</p>

				<p><strong>It's time for a new <i>pawsibly</i> of a bright, exciting fur-ture.</strong> </p>

			<div class="bio">
				<p>Bailey is an English Cocker Spaniel, full of experience and wisdom. Though she's twelve years old, she's still as fiesty and spry as ever. She's been around the block and seen her fair share of politics. Bailey is excited to be Ginger's vice presidential candidate and campaign around this great country with her. Ginger's sense of commitment to her country and community is what brought them together originally and they've helped make Monroe County stronger ever since.</p>
				<p>She's held many offices in New York, including Mayor of Fairport in 2010, Monroe County Clerk in 2012, and NY District 55 Senator in 2014. She loves living in Fairport, NY and has been an active member of this beautiful community her whole life. She can usually be found taking walks along the Canal Path with Ginger, greeting constituents, and doing community service with local organizations. As vice president, she'd like to bring the values and connectivity of her community to all of America. </p>
