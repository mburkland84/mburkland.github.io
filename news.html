			<p>If you're a Rochester local, it's not too late to come out and enjoy the beautiful flowers in Highland Park at the 121st Lilac Festival. Come enjoy flowers, craft vendors, live music, and delicious food. I'll be out greeting constituents all day so stop and have a chat if you see me!

			<p>It's never too cold for a walk here in beautiful Fairport, NY. Even with all this snow on the ground! Make sure to get some fresh air during the winter and stay active to fight away those winter blues. Whenever I'm able to get out of the office and enjoy my local park, I always feel refreshed and ready to put my mind to America's greatest problems!

			<p>Medical bills getting you down? I know that feeling. As a dog that suffers from a multitude of food allergies and occassional seizures, medical bills can be ruff. That's why I'm for medicare for all. Citizens shouldn't have to pay for a condition they were born with just to get by.
