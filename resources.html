		<h3>Information Sources used in the creation of this site</h3>
		<p>No information sources were used when making this page. It's a fiction webpage about my dog running for president.</p>

		<h3>Which element of the site is the graphic created from scratch</h3>
		<p>A few graphics were made from scratch. The first is the icon on the register to vote button on the homepage. The second is the icon for the voting polls locator on the homepage. The third is the "Ginger for America" icon in the navigation bar. The fourth is the dividers (which are featured on this page). All of these I made in Adobe Illustrator.</p>

		<h3>What type of embedded media was used on the site and on which pages(s) it is located</h3>
		<p> The type of embedded media I used was two videos of my dog on the <a href="http://serenity.ist.rit.edu/~mxb7154/140/project3/news.html">News page</a>. The first is the first post on the news page and the second is the last post on the news page.</p>

		<h3> Which image uses CSS rollover effect</h3>
		<p>Sorry, I couldn't figure it out so I didn't. I would have liked to put a overlay on the picture of Ginger overlooking the neighborhood on the index.html page but it didn't work out.</p>

		<h3> Details about Javascript used and an explanation of why it enhances your site.</h3>

		<p>The Javascript I used was to make the slideshow on the <a href="http://serenity.ist.rit.edu/~mxb7154/140/project3/photos.html">Photos page</a>. It enhances my site by allowing the photos to actually scroll without the page reloading, which is really what makes a photo gallery.

		<h3>A two-to-three paragraph summary about your website</h3>

		<p>Since this project came out around Election Day in America, I had been looking at a lot of campaign wesbites. I was very interested in the designs and web developement skills they used so I decided to make one of my own. This website is for the "Ginger for America" campaign, where my Goldendoodle, Ginger, is running for president. The homepage has a brief overview of Ginger and Bailey, the presidential and vice presidential candidates. It also has some testimonies to sway voters and show they have ample support. There's also an experience page which has Ginger's views and experiences as well as the members of her campaign team. The photos page has photos of Ginger since starting on the campiagn trail, doing various works of community service, canvasing, and other presidential duties. The news page has posts containing videos and pictures that track her campaign. The final page is a contact page which has various ways to contact her as well as a form to join her cause and volunteer.</p>

		
		<p>I believe my best work was the news page, the homepage, and the photo gallery. The news page is really fun and unique with little stories of various pictures I've taken of Ginger over the years. It's also formatted well and looks very interesting. I also thought the editing on the campaign announcement video was adequate for never having edited a video in my life. The homepage is very well organized and spaced, including many interesting features like the "Register to Vote" and "Voting Polls Locator" buttons, the bios of my dogs, and first image of Ginger looking out at the neighborhood. I thought the font choice and buttons were top quality especially. The photo gallery is very fun and functional, with good photos, creative captions, and it works very nicely. It's something I probably wouldn't have been able to pursue in a different project so I'm glad I was able to here since it's a good element to know how to make. </p>

		<p>Two factors of the site I feel could use improvement are the header, and the contact page. The header has a lot of blank space on the sides of the logo, which I wasn't sure how to fix. The contact page could be better formatted. I'd like the form to look a little more like <a href="https://www.adambello2019.com/volunteer">Adam Bello's volunteer page</a> since it's so interesting and visually pleasing.</p>
